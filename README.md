# SAFNet
Here is the SAFNet model code. The SAF dataset and details will be updated here after the paper is accepted.

Paper name: Southwestern Atlantic Ocean Fronts Detected from the Fusion of Multi-source Remote Sensing Data by A Deep Learning Model

Jouranl: Frontiers in Marine Science

Folder "Input_data" contains the input data of Figure 3 in the paper. It mainly includes SST and ADT data for 4 days.

When running the program, put 'Input_data', 'model', 'Predict.py' and 'SAFNet.pth' in the same folder, and then the model can be run in terminal using "python Predict.py".

The pre-trained model "SAFNet.pth" can be downloaded from Baidu NetDisk.
